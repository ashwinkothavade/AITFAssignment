Hi, this is our technical test. Please read and start.

Purpose: To gain a deeper understanding of your interest in and motivation to learn about cutting-edge technology such as generative AI.

Assignment: Create a chatbot that combines a free, publicly available weather API with generative AI and supports voice input. 
- The theme is flexible: travel, outings, fashion, music, agriculture, sports, or anything else you’d like AI to suggest. 
- Submission deadline: Friday, September 26, 20:00 IST.

- ⁠Target users / use cases: up to you. 
- ⁠Core functional requirements: Japanese voice input (mandatory), weather retrieval, proposal generation by generative AI. 
- ⁠Non-functional requirements: none specified. 
- ⁠Weather API: your choice. Generative AI / LLM: any model of your choice (cost to be borne by you). 
- ⁠Tech stack: your choice.

Deliverables: 
(1) A working demo URL or a video 
(2) Source code (GitHub repository preferred).
